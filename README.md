" ..\\SchoolCanteens\\SchoolCanteensApplication"

" ..\\SchoolCanteens\\SchoolCanteensDomain"

" ..\\SchoolCanteens\\SchoolCanteensInfrastructure"

Note: 



Initially my personal system was not having all the latest tools, technologies and libraries to get started quickly and develop faster. I needed to setup all these software and technologies and libraries to hit the ground running.
